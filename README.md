## VM WOODWORKING

This program simulates an E-commerce platform, providing the following functionalities:
- Selecting multiple products
- Inspecting product details
- Adding and removing products from the shopping cart
- Confirming a purchase and obtaining an Order ID from the checkout.

# Technologies

This application is developed using ReactJS as part of a course on the same technology. Its modules are designed following the architecture and dynamics of a shopping cart.
To develop this app I use [Vite] as a building tool.
